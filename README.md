# IG Followers Check

A script that checks your Instagram account exported data, to show you who is following you back and who's not.

To export your Instagram data, go here: https://www.instagram.com/download/request/
Remember to request to download the "JSON" version.

Once downloaded, put your files into the /src/assets/data folder, so the folder will look like:

```
$ ls /src/assets/data

removed_suggestions.json
blocked_profiles.json
close_friends.json
followers_1.json
following_hashtags.json
following.json
pending_follow_requests.json
recent_follow_requests.json
recently_unfollowed_profiles.json
```
